## Critical Path Risk Analysis

### High-Risk Critical Path Items

#### 1. Week 5: Order Processing Engine (Days 29-35)
**Risk Level**: HIGH
**Impact**: Delays entire project by 1-2 weeks
**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Assign senior developer with WebSocket experience
- Start WebSocket proof of concept in Week 4
- Have backup messaging solution ready (Redis pub/sub)
- Daily progress reviews during this week

#### 2. Week 9-11: Payment Integration (Days 57-77)
**Risk Level**: VERY HIGH
**Impact**: Could delay launch by 2-4 weeks
**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Begin Stripe integration research in Week 6
- Engage security consultant early
- Plan for parallel PCI compliance work
- Have fallback to simpler payment method

#### 3. Week 19: System Integration Testing (Days 127-133)
**Risk Level**: HIGH
**Impact**: Could reveal fundamental integration issues
**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Continuous integration testing throughout development
- Weekly integration checkpoints
- Have dedicated testing environment ready
- Plan for parallel bug fixing team

### Critical Path Optimization Strategies

#### Parallel Work Opportunities
1. **Employee Management (Weeks 12-14)** can be developed while payment security is being finalized
2. **Inventory Management (Weeks 15-18)** can be developed independently after basic auth is complete
3. **Mobile App (Weeks 16-18)** can be developed as soon as core ordering system is stable

#### Buffer Time Allocation
- **Week 8**: Built-in buffer for core ordering system issues
- **Week 14**: Buffer for payment integration complexity
- **Week 20**: Buffer for final testing and bug fixes

#### Fast-Track Options
If ahead of schedule:
- Advance mobile app development to start in Week 14
- Begin inventory management in Week 13
- Add extra testing week before launch
