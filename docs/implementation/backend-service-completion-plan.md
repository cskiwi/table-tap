// REQUIRED FIX:
import { OrderService, InventoryService, EmployeeService } from '@app/backend-services';
```

#### 2. DataLoader Service Implementation
```typescript
// MISSING: DataLoader service for N+1 query optimization
// REQUIRED: libs/backend/graphql/src/dataloaders/index.ts

export class DataLoaderService {
  orderItemsByOrderId: DataLoader<string, OrderItem[]>;
  paymentsByOrderId: DataLoader<string, Payment[]>;
  cafeById: DataLoader<string, Cafe>;
  lowStockItemsByCafeId: DataLoader<string, Inventory[]>;
  // ... additional loaders
}
```

#### 3. Missing PubSub Integration Methods
```typescript
// MISSING: Additional Redis PubSub methods for restaurant operations
// LOCATION: RedisPubSubService

async publishStockAlert(alert: StockAlert): Promise<number> {
  // Implementation needed
}

async publishEmployeeCreated(employee: EmployeeEvent): Promise<number> {
  // Implementation needed
}

async publishPaymentProcessed(payment: PaymentEvent): Promise<number> {
  // Implementation needed
}
```
