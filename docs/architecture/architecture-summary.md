# Table Tap - System Architecture Summary

## Executive Overview

I have designed a comprehensive system architecture for the Table Tap drink/bar/restaurant ordering system that meets all specified requirements while ensuring scalability, security, and maintainability. The architecture supports multi-device ordering, real-time operations, multi-payment processing, employee management, and inventory tracking across multiple cafe locations.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Angular 17+ with PrimeNG components and Tailwind CSS
- **Mobile**: Capacitor for cross-platform deployment
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ with Redis caching
- **Real-time**: Socket.io WebSocket implementation
- **Infrastructure**: Docker containers with Kubernetes orchestration

### Core Design Patterns
- **Microservices Architecture**: Modular, scalable service design
- **Multi-tenancy**: Cafe-based data isolation with shared infrastructure
- **Event-driven Architecture**: Real-time updates via WebSocket events
- **CQRS Pattern**: Separate read/write operations for performance
- **Repository Pattern**: Clean data access abstraction

### Scalability Features
- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling**: CPU, memory, and custom metrics
- **Database Read Replicas**: Load distribution for read operations
- **Multi-level Caching**: In-memory, Redis, and database caching
- **WebSocket Clustering**: Redis-based message distribution
- **Geographic Distribution**: Multi-region deployment capability

### Security Implementation
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **RBAC Permissions**: Fine-grained access control
- **Field-level Encryption**: Sensitive data protection
- **PCI DSS Compliance**: Payment data security standards
- **Comprehensive Audit Logging**: Full activity tracking

## System Capabilities

### Order Management
- Real-time order creation and status tracking
- Configurable workflow steps per cafe
- Multi-counter distribution with activation/deactivation
- Proxy ordering for employees with audit trails

### Payment Processing
- Multiple payment methods (QR codes, Payconic, cash, credits)
- Configurable tip suggestions per cafe
- Secure payment processing with tokenization
- Credit system management

### Employee Management
- Comprehensive timesheet tracking
- Personal drink allowance monitoring
- Proxy ordering capabilities
- Performance analytics and reporting

### Inventory Management
- Real-time stock level tracking
- Automatic reorder limit alerts
- Purchase tracking with receipt management
- Optional glass tracking system
- Performance analytics and monthly breakdowns

## Performance Targets
- **Response Time**: < 200ms for API calls
- **Throughput**: 10,000+ concurrent orders
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime
- **Scalability**: Support 1,000+ cafes with 100+ concurrent users each

## Architecture Benefits

### Scalability
- Microservices enable independent scaling of components
- Kubernetes provides automatic scaling based on demand
- Database sharding supports unlimited cafe growth
- WebSocket clustering handles massive concurrent connections

### Security
- Defense-in-depth security architecture
- PCI DSS compliant payment processing
- Comprehensive audit trails for compliance
- Role-based access control for fine-grained permissions

### Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns with microservices
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Consistent coding patterns and standards
- Automated testing and deployment pipelines

### Flexibility
- Multi-tenant architecture supports diverse cafe needs
- Configurable workflows and features per location
- Plugin-based architecture for future extensions
- API-first design enables multiple client applications

## Next Steps for Implementation

2. **Database Implementation**: Create PostgreSQL schema and initial migrations
3. **Authentication Service**: Implement JWT-based authentication system
4. **Core API Development**: Build fundamental CRUD operations
5. **WebSocket Implementation**: Add real-time communication layer
6. **Frontend Development**: Create Angular applications with PrimeNG
7. **Payment Integration**: Implement payment gateway connections
8. **Testing & QA**: Comprehensive testing across all components
9. **Security Audit**: Validate security implementations
10. **Performance Optimization**: Load testing and optimization

## Architecture Storage

All architectural decisions and specifications have been stored in Redis memory under the key `table_tap_architecture` for easy reference by other development agents. This includes:

- System overview and core components
- Technology stack decisions
